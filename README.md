All my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges in 2022


https://adventofcode.com/2022/

Summary of challenges in order I did them (minor hints):

11: Definitely needed help with this one in terms of the mathematical trick needed to solve it. Did a bit more of a functional/object solution than most people seeemd to do.

10: Some struggling with the display counter needing to reset. Overall much easier than day 11.

9+8: Simple enough.

7: Note that the example directory was not included.
